This the project on currency convertor.

README FILE (TECHNICAL -
DOCUMENTATION)


Small description:
Project name is Currency converter. This project convert money of one currency to another. In this project, the concept of python like function,
operators, Conditional statement , Loops and many more concepts are used. I had use top down design and many more things. This Project comes in financial category. This project aims the real life problems like people wants to know how much "amount in any currency" can be in other currency
.Project's objective is to help people who travel from one country to another for any purpose.
Those people can use this project to know how much money of specific currency is in another
currency which may help them in transaction and many more. I had applied maximum concept of
vityarthi in this project .This project is user friendly tooo that is we don't need to execute whole
 
program after each output of converted currency.
I had tested this project and this project is perfectly executable.



This project should aim to:
1.	Identify a real-world problem or need: This
project aims real life problem like people wants to know how much "amount in any currency" can be in other currency. This project targets real life
problem no doubt. This project is user friendly too.

2.	Define clear objectives and expected outcomes:
Project's objective is to help people who travel from one country to another for any purpose.
Project outcome is that its return converted value of currency in different kind of currency .This
project is user friendly tooo that is we don't need to execute whole program after each output of converted currency .
Expected output is:
 
 


3.	Apply concepts learned in the course to design the solution: I had applied most of the concept I
learnt during classes. I had used concept of python language like functions, conditional statements
,loops, Boolean value, break statement ,printing statement ,Operator ,Return statement and many more..

4.	Use appropriate tools, libraries, or programming techniques based on the subject: I had used
appropriate tools, libraries or programming
techniques based on the subject. In my project no libraries got installed.

5.	Follow a structured development process: I had followed structured development process like
aiming , planning, coding, testing, documenting. I had first decided what project is about, how this
project will overcome real life problem, what is the aim of the project. Secondly, I had planned how
 
this project is going to done ,made algorithm and flowchart before coding process. Then I had
started with coding process that was easy part for me because algorithm and flowchart helped me a lot. Now after coding there is a testing part, This project passed testing by showing perfect output as expected. At last I had done documentation.

6.		Problem definition: A problem is a task defined by its inputs, desired outputs, and constraints, which can be solved with an algorithm, It's often viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs, and
computer science is the study of algorithms that
solve these problems, including those that may not have a solution. In this project ,it resolve the
problem of converting currency by convert
currency from one currency to another by doing two to three clicks.

7.	Requirement analysis: The requirement for this
project is zero. You only need any python compiler. That’s it.

8.	Top-Down design: I had used top down design in my project. That is by defining what’s the problem after that by initialising loop variable for while loop
 
then created the body of while loop. Then I had asked user to continue while loop or to exit the program by entering NO.

9.	Algorithm development: I had implemented algorithm and algorithm is shown below:









 
 
 
10.	Implementation: I had implemented things like aiming , planning, coding, testing, documenting. I had first decided what project is about, how this
project will overcome real life problem, what is the aim of the project. Secondly, I had planned how this project is going to done ,made algorithm and flowchart before coding process. Then I had
started with coding process that was easy part for me because algorithm and flowchart helped me a lot. Now after coding there is a testing part, This project passed testing by showing perfect output as expected. At last I had done documentation.

11.	Testing and refinement: This project passed testing by showing perfect output as expected so no
refinement is required.
